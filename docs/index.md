  This provider gives a possibility to use data sources as containers for measurement units and converting them in an interoperable manner.
  Problem to solve
  Tired of lacking possibility of an easy definition of quantities?One resource asks for disk size in GiB and other resource outputs it in MB?Tired of writing code like this?
  
  resource "cloud_provider_disk" "this" {
  	size = var.disk_size_gib * 1024 * 1024 * 1024
  }
  
  resource "another_cloud_provider_disk" "that" {
  	size_gb = ceil((var.disk_size_gib * (1024 * 1024 * 1024)) / (1000 * 1000 * 1000))
  }
  
  Solution
  Simply use:
  
  data "units_data_size" "disk" {
  	gibibytes = var.disk_size_gib
  }
  
  resource "cloud_provider_disk" "this" {
  	size = data.units_data_size.disk.bytes
  }
  
  resource "another_cloud_provider_disk" "that" {
  	size_gb = ceil(data.units_data_size.disk.gigabytes)
  }
  
  Liability
  This provider is not intended to do automatic rounding and outputs conversion results as is.
  Since results are numbers, they can be both ints and floats.
  Do not forget checking computed values and provide additional handling logic.

# units Provider

This provider gives a possibility to use data sources as containers for measurement units and converting them in an interoperable manner.

## Problem to solve

- Tired of lacking possibility of an easy definition of quantities?
- One resource asks for disk size in GiB and other resource outputs it in MB?
- Tired of writing code like this?

```terraform
resource "cloud_provider_disk" "this" {
	size = var.disk_size_gib * 1024 * 1024 * 1024
}

resource "another_cloud_provider_disk" "that" {
	size_gb = ceil((var.disk_size_gib * (1024 * 1024 * 1024)) / (1000 * 1000 * 1000))
}
```

## Solution

Simply use:

```terraform
data "units_data_size" "disk" {
	gibibytes = var.disk_size_gib
}

resource "cloud_provider_disk" "this" {
	size = data.units_data_size.disk.bytes
}

resource "another_cloud_provider_disk" "that" {
	size_gb = ceil(data.units_data_size.disk.gigabytes)
}
```

## Liability

This provider is not intended to do automatic rounding and outputs conversion results as is.
Since results are `number`s, they can be both `int`s and `float`s.

Do not forget checking computed values and provide additional handling logic.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "units" {}
```
